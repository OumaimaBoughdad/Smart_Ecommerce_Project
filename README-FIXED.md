# E-commerce Analytics Platform - Fixed Solution

This document provides instructions for the fixed solution to the Kubernetes deployment issues.

## Issues Fixed

1. **ML Model and Scraper CrashLoopBackOff**: 
   - Converted Deployments to Jobs since these are one-time tasks that run to completion

2. **Dashboard Streamlit Error**:
   - Fixed the Streamlit app code to not use `st.chat_message()` which is only available in newer Streamlit versions
   - Mounted the fixed code using a ConfigMap

## How to Access the Dashboard

The dashboard is now running and can be accessed at:

```
http://192.168.49.2:31425
```

Where:
- `192.168.49.2` is your Minikube IP
- `31425` is the NodePort assigned to the dashboard service

## Components

1. **Jobs**:
   - `ml-model-job`: Processes data and generates insights
   - `scraper-job`: Collects product data

2. **Deployments**:
   - `dashboard`: Visualizes the insights with the fixed Streamlit app

3. **Services**:
   - `dashboard-service`: Exposes the dashboard on NodePort 31425

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check pod status:
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```

2. Check pod logs:
   ```
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```

3. If the dashboard shows errors, check the ConfigMap is properly mounted:
   ```
   kubectl describe pod -l app=dashboard
   ```

4. To restart the dashboard:
   ```
   kubectl rollout restart deployment dashboard
   ```

5. To run the ML model or scraper again:
   ```
   kubectl delete job ml-model-job
   kubectl apply -f k8s/ml-model-job.yaml
   ```
